## Welcome!  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30">

Welcome and thank you for stopping by. This project focuses on a regression problem, aiming to demonstrate the various steps involved in developing a Machine Learning pipeline (pre-implementation stage), rather than emphasizing the intricacies of the modeling itself.

## Motivation

The objective of our model is to **predict the popularity of accommodations**, utilizing the objective variable `reviews_per_month`. This target variable serves as a reliable proxy for popularity since Airbnb incentivizes users to leave reviews on the platform. Consequently, reviews play a crucial role in decision-making when selecting accommodations from the numerous available options.

## About the data

The dataset comprises properties listed on Airbnb in New York in 2019. Each record in the dataset is associated with a unique identifier (id) and includes 15 attributes related to each property. Among these attributes, 6 are categorical, while 9 are numeric, encompassing both discrete and continuous values. The attributes provide information about the host, geographic location, property type, price, restrictions, and reviews. The dataset is substantial, containing nearly 49,000 records before any processing is performed. Below is a summary of the variables of the dataset:

|variable |class     |description |
